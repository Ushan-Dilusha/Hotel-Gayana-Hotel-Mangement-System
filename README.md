**Brief Description of Project** - To carry out our ITP project this semester, we undertook to create software system for a hotel management system for the Hotel Gayana which is situated in Tangalle as our client. Hotel Gayana is a banquet hotel, and it is specifically made for room reservations with a high standard of service to the customers. Previously the tasks which were functioning in this hotel such as controlling, monitoring, maintaining, and scheduling the hotel activities have been carried out manually and in our project, such tasks as Hotel Room Management, Banquet Hall Management, Restaurant Management, Transport Management, Room Reservation, Employee Management, Inventory Management, Service Management, and relevant report generation functions should be designed in such a way that they are run with the help of the newly developed software system. Simply all the above-mentioned operations can be done with the use of this single software system via online. Features of this hotel management system come up with an attractive user interface combined with strong search entries and reporting capabilities. Also, this is very user-friendly, and this software system allows users to perform their tasks such as accessing and storing data, doing calculations, and collecting feedback within a remarkable time. For instance, the Admin of this system can manage the booking requests of the customers. On the other hand, customers can make requests for room reservations with the use of this software system. In consequence, this system is useful for both managers and customers to do and manage their tasks and all the hotel activities in a portable way.
